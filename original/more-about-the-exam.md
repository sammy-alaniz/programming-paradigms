Hi All,

I hope you are having a nice week.  This is a reminder that our exam will be on Saturday. Here are some more details.

- We will start at 8:30am to give everyone time to arrive and to prepare in place.
- The only thing you need are a couple of pens/pencils.
- The best way to prepare is to do a practice exam (one I already shared)
- Other ways to practice is to simply take the notes we had and solve those problems in various languages/libraries (or come up with slightly diff problem.
- There will be 4 questions on the exam (it is still under construction, but topics that are always likely to be there include
  - syntax+grammar (see the example from the past exam)
  - Ocaml (see the example from the past exam)
  - CSP (see notes)
  - Linda (see notes and operations)
